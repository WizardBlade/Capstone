Welcome to my capstone project! 

To download, if you haven't already, code >> download .zip >> open zip >> game.html >> play

to play:

left click or spacebar = jump
(you have to click first before using the spacebar)

L = lightmode
D = darkmode
F = sound off
N = sound on
C = change colour

Also rate my game 5 stars.

This takes a bit of practice to feel the physics, but it's easy when you get the hang of it.

Avoid the obstacles
beat your own high score

Also tell Blake that he's really cool and that his game is awesome.
