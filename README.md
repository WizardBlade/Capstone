Welcome to my capstone project! 

To download, if you haven't already, code >> download .zip >> open zip >> game.html >> play



to play:

left click = jump

don't spam click, your jumps will fail and you will fall to the ground and probably die

Wait until you have reached the top of your jump to click again.

This takes a bit of practice to feel the physics, but it's easy when you get the hang of it.



Avoid the obstacles
beat your own high score



Also tell Blake that he's really cool and that his game is awesome.
